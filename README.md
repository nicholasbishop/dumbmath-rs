# Dumbmath

[![](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasbishop/dumbmath-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasbishop/dumbmath-rs)

This package is a Rust experiment in making a pretty dumb math library
oriented towards computer graphics. By dumb I mean that it's a bit
C-ish in style rather than Haskell-ish or C++ Boost-ish.
